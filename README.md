# Adaline-Learning-Algorithm-Using-MSE
Single layer neural networks which can be able to classify a stream of input data to one of a set of predefined classes.
WE used the penguins data in both training and testing processes. (Each class has 50 samples: train NN with 30 non-repeated samples randomly selected, and test it with the remaining 20 samples)
